# Line-following-robot
This project is all about a line follower drop mobile robot, which  is an automotive line following and will detect the obstacles then drop the object. The operating systems of this line follower drop mobile robot are as following; when the switch is on, the motor will start to move forward by default. Next, when the IR sensor sense white line, the motor will on and off and that depends on the black line until finish the track. After finish the track, the ultrasonic sensor will start function and detect the distance of both obstacles. Lastly after reach the point, the servo motor will turn and drop the object. The designed mobiles robot is a three wheeled Robot with differential steering. The Robot has one servo motor, two Ultrasonic Sensors and two IR sensors. The main controller of the robot is implemented in a PIC microcontroller. The Algorithms runs on the PIC microcontroller based on the information received by the IR sensors and Ultrasonic Ranger.
